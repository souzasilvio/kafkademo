# kafkademo
Demonstration project to produce and consume kafka messages. This demo was made using developer account on Confluent Kafka (https://confluent.cloud/).

This sample implements a producer/consumer pattern as shown in this diagraman.
Use:
1. Get this project using VS Code or VS 2022 whith .NET 6 Support.
2. Create a file on solution folder with name "getting-started.properties" and below content:

bootstrap.servers=<Grab Bootstrap server address on your Confluent Kafka portal>
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN
sasl.username=<Grab key name created on API Keys inside your Confluent Kafka portal>
sasl.password=<Grab key secret created on API Keys inside your Confluent Kafka portal>

3. Create a cluster with named "clientes". If you prefer other name, go ahead and change topic name on files producer.cs and consumer.cs.
4. Build and run both project. Each project require path name of file "getting-started.properties" as you can see on then Main method of producer.cs and consumer.cs files. Make sure to adjust this path for your case.
